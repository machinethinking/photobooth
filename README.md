photobooth
==========

This photobooth software was designed to be used in a social setting. In batches, photographs taken 
are displayed in loop with a delay. When there are not enough new photographs to refill the
loop, previously taken photographs are randomly selected to fill the gap.

Requirements:
A camera connected via (probably) USB.
A program, like OSX Image Capture which will trigger the camera and download the picture
A person to trigger the photos
An external program to diplay the photos in a loop. I use xbmc.
